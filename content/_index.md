	<p>Your marketing campaigns don't live up to the expectations.</p>
	<p>It's because you don't know the <b>SECRET</b> to copywriting.</p>

				<p>This Discord server with {{< highlight >}}300+ people{{< /highlight >}} was built to facilitate the growth of the Hungarian self-improvement community.</p>
				<p>Are you wondering about how I made a server so big in so little time?</p>
				<p>I caught a very good wave: a bigger foreign server wanted to foster local branches.</p>
				<p>Was I prepared?</p> 
				<p>Did I know ahead that this opportunity will rise up, right?</p> 
				<p>WRONG!</p>
				<p>This was my very first server.</p>
				<p>To this day this community is kept up by our valuable members, and we're going ahead together...</p>

				<p>A community whose goal is to get students through the Hungarian education system as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>I was always expected to excel with my academic results.</p>
				<p>My parents will be forever in the belief that a diploma is the goal of life.</p>
				<p>I guess it's good for showing that I attended something for 4 years...</p>
				<p>I find it disgusting that an institution has the right to steal 20+ years from your life so you get some "general knowledge".</p>
				<p>If we can't change the game, we've to change the players.</p>
				<p>...and artifical intelligence just popped it's head up in the right moment...</p>

			<p>My days consist of observing people's interesting and almost unexplainable behaviour, then creating win-win situations for all of us.</p>
			<p>How in the world will a geek who just wanted to die in an air conditioned, white office; become an adventure-seeking, strong, brave, valuable and ambitious man?</p>
			<p>In my childhood I was always looked down upon: not even bullied.</p>
			<p>Just <b>ignored.</b></p>
			<p>Believe me, 99% of man has this terrifying experience throughout their whole miserable lives.</p>
			<p>I was backstabbed and failed in many ventures a lot...</p>
			<p>...yet I always got up from the dust.</p>
			<p>I consider myself to be the luckiest person alive simply for the fact that it was never enough to let the wind of fate carry me throughout my journey.</p>
			<p>I've never won with retarded lottery tickets, and I'm proud of that.</p>
			<p><b>While you wait for the grass to grow under your feet, I've built an empire...</b></p>
