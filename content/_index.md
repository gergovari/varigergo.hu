				<p>This Discord server with {{< highlight >}}300+ people{{< /highlight >}} was built to facilitate the growth of the Hungarian self-improvement community.</p>
				<p>Are you wondering about how I made a server so BIG in so <small>little</small> time?</p>
				<p>I caught a very good wave in the ocean of life: a bigger foreign server wanted to foster local branches.</p>
				<p>I did know ahead that this opportunity will rise up, right?</p> 
				<p>WRONG!</p>
				<p>...but my ship's sail was already set to the direction of success.</p>
				<p>This was my very first server.</p>
				<p>To this day the community is kept up by our valuable members, and we're going ahead together...</p>

				<p>IMAX is the cutting-edge of modern-day cinema.</p>
				<p>They'll sparkle <b class="cold-color">cold water</b> in your eyes when someone jumps into the pool on a hot summer day.</p>
				<p>You can smell the <b class="gasoline-color">gasoline</b> in a Fast and Furious movie as they speed beside you.</p>
				<p>The <b class="explosion-color">rumble</b> that would be created by the shot of bullets is generated by a HUGE subwoofer just so you can experience it in your stomach.</p>
				<p>I just created a {{< highlight >}}vivid{{< /highlight >}} mental imagery in your brain, almost like a movie.</p>
				<p>This is the perfect state to influence and show people the truth.</p>
				<p>I've started to foster this skill in The Real World, and I'm only getting better at it with each passing day.</p>
				<p>In order to gain people's focus in our attention economy, you NEED to use stories.</p>
				<p>I can even make your most <small>mundane</small> day into the BEST tale anyone has ever read.</p>

				<p>A community whose goal is to get students through the Hungarian education system as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>I was always expected to excel with my academic results.</p>
				<p>My parents will be forever in the wrong belief that a diploma is the goal of life.</p>
				<p>It's good for showing that I attended something for 4 years but...</p>
				<p>I find it disgusting that an institution has the right to {{< highlight >}}steal 20+ years{{< /highlight >}} from your life so you get some <i>"general knowledge"</i>.</p>
				<p>If we can't change the game, we've to change the players.</p>
				<p>...and our beloved {{< highlight >}}artifical intelligence{{< /highlight >}} just popped it's head up in the right moment...</p>

			<p>My days consist of observing people's interesting and almost unexplainable behaviour, then creating win-win situations for all of us.</p>
			<p>How in the world will a geek who just wanted to die in an air conditioned, white office; become an adventure-seeking, strong, brave, valuable and ambitious man?</p>
			<p>In my childhood I was always looked down upon: not even bullied.</p>
			<p>Just <b>ignored.</b></p>
			<p>Believe me, 99% of men has this terrifying experience throughout their whole miserable lives.</p>
			<p>I was backstabbed and failed in many ventures a lot...</p>
			<p>...yet I always got up from the dust.</p>
			<p>I consider myself to be the luckiest person alive simply for the fact that it was never enough to let the wind of fate carry me throughout my journey.</p>
			<p>I've never won with retarded lottery tickets, and I'm proud of that.</p>
			<p><b>While you wait for the grass to grow under your feet, I've built an empire...</b></p>
